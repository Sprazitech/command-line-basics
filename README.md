Create a directory structure on Linux:

Create a folder named projects.
Inside projects, create subfolders: week1, week2.

Solution

Go to your terminal, using GitBash or Linux. For this assignment I am using GitBash.
i. Create a directory and create a folder named "Projects" using

mkdir projects

ii. To create subfolders: week1, week2, inside "projects" folder.
Firstly, I made sure i was in my "project" folder using this prompt

cd projects

Secondly, I then created my subfolders: week1, week2 using this prompt

mkdir week1 week2

To be sure my subfolders were created in my projects folder using this prompt
ls
This was how my output looked like after completing task 1.
